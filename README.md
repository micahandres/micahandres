<h1>Micah Andres </h1>
 
ðŸ”­ I currently do research at National University of Singapore <a href="https://aicet.comp.nus.edu.sg/">AI Centre for Educational Technologies</a> (AICET), where I am exploring the development of conversational AI agents engaging in dialogue conversation with each other and understanding the adapability of AI agents in conversational speech. Additionally, I have conducted research at Carnegie Mellon University at the <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/">Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a> as part of the Teledia Lab over the past summer! 

ðŸ“— Some of my personal research interests are focused on Applied Machine Learning, Human-Centered AI, User-Centered Frameworks, and Conversational Agents.

ðŸŽ¨ In my free time, I love to make art and sketch in my free time! Please feel free to check out my <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/micahsa/home">Art portfolio</a> or <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/micahsanandres/home">User Experience portfolio</a> as well!
